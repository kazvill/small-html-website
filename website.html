	<br>
	<p1>AMD CPUs are generally better for multitasking. Ryzen is AMD's most recent 
	<br>series of processors released in 2017. All Ryzen CPUs are unlocked allowing users
	<br> overclock their processors and push their CPUs past their factory specifications
	<br> and achieve higher clock speeds which offer more processing power.

	<h3>Why do we use thermal paste?</h3>
	<p1>Thermal paste is a high head conductive paste that is used between the CPU and heatsink
	<br>to get better heat transefer. It also fills in micro indentations on the lid of the CPU
	<br> which can trap air and decrease the heatsink's performance in cooling.
